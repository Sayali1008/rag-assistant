What is DFS Crawling?
DFS (Depth-First Search) is a traversal strategy where you:
- Start at a root (seed) URL.
- Visit one page.
- From that page, follow one of its links to the next page, and continue going deep until there are no new links left.
- Then backtrack and continue with the next link.
So it explores deep paths first before moving to other branches — like exploring one long tunnel at a time.

Why DFS Works Well for Docs
- Documentation sites are hierarchical (sections → subsections → topics).
- DFS naturally explores sections deeply, which is ideal for full content extraction.
- It's easy to implement with recursion or an explicit stack.


Given this PDF: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/bedrock/latest/userguide/bedrock-ug.pdf, if we want to extract the content by extracting table of contents, and page numbers and sections for each page, we need to understand how many pages are consumed by each section. The table of contents has no numbers but rather a tab spacing technique which determines the content in regards to section, sub-section, sub-sub-section, and so on. In python, how can this be achieved?


TO DO:
- Revisit subsection handling, hierarchy, and smarter chunking during optimization when you’re refining retrieval accuracy.
